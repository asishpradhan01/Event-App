        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Local Events, a simple yet powerful web app designed and developed by Asish Pradhan.
         This platform helps communities stay informed about local gatherings, festivals, workshops, and activities happening nearby.</p>
         <p>The idea behind Local Events came from a small-town perspective — where people often hear about local functions or celebrations only 
            after they’ve happened.
             This app aims to bridge that gap by providing a central place to discover, share, and join upcoming community events.</p>
            <p class="down">Currently, users can:</p>
            <li>View details about featured local events</li>
            <li>Join events by submitting their details through a registration form</li>
            <li>Create new event listings with title, location, and description</li>
            <p>This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, and a lightweight Node.js + Express backend to handle user data
                 submissions.
                 All event and user details are safely stored in local JSON files for now.</p>
            <p>An Events Page is in development and will soon allow users to explore all upcoming and past events, making the experience more interactive and connected.</p>
            <p>Designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, Local Events demonstrates how even small digital tools can bring communities closer together.</p>
