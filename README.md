🌍 Local Events Web App
Designed and Developed by Asish Pradhan
📖 Overview

The Local Events Web App is a community-driven platform created to help villagers discover, create, and join local events easily.
This project aims to bring people together, promote local culture, and strengthen community bonds by making event sharing more accessible.

💡 Purpose & Impact

Many villages lack a centralized place to share information about social gatherings, cultural events, and public activities.
This app helps bridge that gap by providing a simple, digital notice board where:

🗓️ Villagers can create events like festivals, meetings, or workshops.

🤝 Users can join community events using a simple online form.

📢 Everyone stays updated about what’s happening in their locality.

By making it easy for villagers to connect and participate, this project encourages unity, participation, and local development.

⚙️ Features

🏡 Create new community events with details like date, time, location, and description.

🎉 View events in a clean and responsive layout.

🧾 Join events through a form that stores participant data securely (via Express middleware).

🔄 Persistent local storage to retain event data even after refreshing.

💬 Contact page linking directly to social media platforms for communication.

📄 Future addition: a dedicated Events Page showing all upcoming events dynamically.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js + Express

Data Handling: JSON-based storage (for simplicity)
